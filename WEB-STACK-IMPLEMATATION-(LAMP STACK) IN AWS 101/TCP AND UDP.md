# What is TCP?

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable communication over IP networks. It guarantees that data packets are delivered in the correct order and retransmits lost or corrupted packets. TCP is like a phone call – you establish a connection, communicate, and then hang up.

# What is UDP?

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that prioritizes speed over reliability. It doesn't guarantee delivery or order, but it's faster and more efficient for applications that don't require guaranteed delivery. UDP is like sending a postcard – you send it, but you're not sure if it arrives.

# Key differences:

* Connection: TCP establishes a connection before transmitting data, while UDP sends data without establishing a connection.
* Reliability: TCP ensures reliable delivery, while UDP does not guarantee delivery.
* Order: TCP ensures packets are delivered in the correct order, while UDP does not guarantee order.
* Speed: UDP is generally faster than TCP due to its lower overhead.

Commonly used ports in web:

* HTTP (Port 80): Hypertext Transfer Protocol, used for web browsing.
* HTTPS (Port 443): Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol, used for secure web browsing.
* SSH (Port 22): Secure Shell, used for secure remote access and management.
* Telnet (Port 23): Used for remote access, but not secure.
* FTP (Port 21): File Transfer Protocol, used for file transfer.
* SFTP (Port 22): Secure File Transfer Protocol, used for secure file transfer.

# What do these ports mean?

* HTTP (Port 80): When you enter a website's URL, your browser sends an HTTP request to port 80 on the server, which responds with the website's content.
* HTTPS (Port 443): Similar to HTTP, but encrypts data for secure communication.
* SSH (Port 22): Used for secure remote access, file transfer, and management.
* Telnet (Port 23): Used for remote access, but not secure (avoid using).
* FTP (Port 21): Used for file transfer, but not secure (avoid using).
* SFTP (Port 22): Used for secure file transfer.

In summary, TCP ensures reliable communication, while UDP prioritizes speed. Understanding the differences between these protocols and the commonly used ports in web applications will help you navigate the world of computer networking with confidence!
