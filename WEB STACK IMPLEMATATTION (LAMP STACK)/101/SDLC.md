# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used to design, develop, test, and deliver software products. It provides a framework for managing the development of software, from the initial planning stages to the final deployment and maintenance stages.

# The SDLC typically includes the following phases:

* Planning: Define project scope, goals, timelines, budget, and resources.
* Requirements Gathering: Collect and document user requirements, functional and non-functional.
* Design: Create architectural designs, user interface designs, and detailed system designs.
* Implementation (Coding): Write the code, develop the software.
* Testing: Verify the software meets requirements, identify and fix defects.
* Deployment: Release the software to production, configure and install.
* Maintenance: Support, update, fix defects, and enhance the software.

# Some popular SDLC models include:

* Waterfall: Linear, sequential phases.
* Agile: Iterative, incremental, flexible, and collaborative.
* V-Model: Development and testing phases are interleaved.
* Spiral: Iterative, risk-driven, and flexible.
* Lean: Focus on eliminating waste, continuous improvement.

# The SDLC helps ensure software is developed on time, within budget, and meets user requirements and quality standards.
